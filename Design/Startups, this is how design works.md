Companies like Apple are making design impossible for startups to ignore. Startups like GitHub, Airbnb, Square, and Fitbit have design at the core of their business, and they're doing phenomenal work. But what is ‘design’ actually? Is it a logo? A Wordpress theme? An innovative UI?

It’s so much more than that. It’s a state of mind. It’s an approach to a problem. It’s how you’re going to kick your competitor’s ass. This handy guide will help you understand design and provide resources to help you find awesome design talent.

1.1 De•sign is a method of problem solving.

The simplest definition. Design is so many things, executed in many different ways, but the function is always the same. Whether it’s blueprints, a clever UI, a brochure, or a chair – design can help solve a visual or physical problem. 

1.2 So what is “good design”?

This definition is not so simple. The best designs are notorious for seeming not designed at all – or ‘undesigned’.

It’s easier if we break things down a bit. If you know what to look for, it’s easier to identify good design when you see it; or perhaps when you can’t see it at all.

1.3 Dieter Rams’ Ten Principles of  “Good Design”

Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products company Braun and functionalist industrial design.

According to Vitsœ: Back in the early 1980s, aware that his design was a significant contributor to the world, he asked himself an important question: 
"Is my design good design?" 

Since good design can't be measured in a finite way, he set about expressing the ten most important principles for what he considered was good design. (Sometimes they are referred as the ‘Ten commandments’.) Here they are.

“We designers, we don’t work in a vacuum. We need business people. We are not the fine artists we are often confused with. Today you find few companies that take design seriously, as I see it.”
— Dieter Rams

1.4 Good design can’t be achieved with glossy buttons or masterful wireframes alone. It’s a merger of all these principles into something that is meaningful and deliberate.

Just like a great business plan is nothing without expert execution, a great Photoshop mockup is nothing, for example, without careful consideration to UI or the user’s needs.

1.5 Objectified

tech gadgets.

1.6 Take a look at your current product – is design contributing in an innovative way? Does it make the product useful, understandable, and aesthetic? Is it long-lasting, or will it look outdated or break in a few years?

These are really hard questions to answer. Designers enable you to work within these constraints to create a product customers will fall in love with. Love is a really strong emotion.

Dieter Rams and his contemporaries started a movement in 20th Century towards simple and beautiful products. Design was a strongly valued aspect of business, even 60 years ago. It totally has a place in business today – it’s a proven method.

There are different kinds of design.

2.1 Graphic Design

This is a term that describes an array of different kinds of designers. Think of it like the term “entrepreneur”. It describes a wide variety of businesspeople - from founders to VC's to “Chief Ninjas” - but isn’t all-inclusive. Graphic designers work with graphical images, whether they be illustrations, typography, or images, and on a variety of media including print and web. Graphic design is typically rendered in 2D – printed on a physical surface or displayed on a screen.

↳ Print Design

A type of graphic designer that works exclusively with print media. Before the widespread adoption of computers, software, and the web, virtually all graphic designers worked on print media such as posters, magazines, billboards, and books. Print designers are typically masters of typography, illustration, and traditional printing processes like the Linotype machine or the letterpress machine, a 500-year-old printing method that has regained popularity in recent years for its handmade and traditional feel.

2.2 Interaction Design

Interaction designers, on the other hand, focus on digital products and interactive software design. Some examples include web apps like Facebook and Pinterest, mobile apps like Tweetbot, and operating systems like OS X. While graphic design is meant to be observed, interaction design helps humans experience or manipulate software or interface with screen-based hardware in order to achieve specific goals – checking email, withdrawing money from an ATM, or "Liking" a webpage (such as this one!)

"Interaction design is heavily focused on satisfying the needs and desires 
of the people who will use the product."

↳ User Interface Design

User Interface (UI) design is the design of software or websites with the focus on the user's experience and interaction. The goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible. Good user interface design puts emphasis on goals and completing tasks, and good UI design never draws more attention to itself than enforcing user goals.

"The design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs."

↳ User Experience Design

User Experience (UX) design "incorporates aspects of psychology, anthropology, sociology, computer science, graphic design, industrial design and cognitive science. Depending on the purpose of the product, UX may also involve content design disciplines such as communication design, instructional design, or game design."

The goal of UX design is to create a seamless, simple, and useful interaction between a user and a product, whether it be hardware or software. As with UI design, user experience design focuses on creating interactions designed to meet or assist a user's goals and needs.

2.3 Industrial Design

Industrial designers create physical products designated for mass-consumption by millions of people. Motorcycles, iPods, toothbrushes, and nightstands are all designed by industrial designers. These people are masters of physical goods and innovation within the constraints of production lines and machines.

"The objective is to study both function and form, and the connection between product, the user, and the environment."

Data: what does the industry think?

3.1 What qualities of design do startups consider most important?

I asked 78 CEOs, marketers, engineers, and designers about their opinions and definitions of design. Before I could come up with anything for this project, I had to check my assumptions at the door and get some legit data. It seems that entrepreneurs / engineers and designers are thinking about the same things.

3.2 How important is product design?

Product design includes both digital and physical products. It represents not only the aesthetic qualities, but what it does, how well a user thinks it's going to do it, and how easily & quickly they can complete a task.

Think for a moment. How important is product design to you? How important do you think aesthetics and ease-of-use are to your customers?

3.3 How deep does design go?

Now we're getting somewhere. Great design is taking root in startup culture, and it seems like many people are open to change. Not only do many entrepreneurs, devs, and engineers see substantial room to improve their own products, they overwhelmingly believe that designers belong on a founding team.

Designer Founders: the missing link

4.1 Startups + designers = ?

For a long time, a pair of co-founders consisted of an executive and an engineer. It worked for Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple, just to name a few. These companies have excellent designers today, because it’s a necessity they can’t afford to ignore. It seems like design is becoming more and more prevalent in new startups as well – Square, Fitbit, Tapbots, and more are pushing the envelope.

Design is becoming a key differentiator for companies to acquire funding, press coverage, 
and loyal users.

I think it’s time to shake things up a bit. 
Let’s add designers into the mix.

4.2 Meet the Designer Founders

According to The Designer Fund, startups with designer founders are generating billions of dollars in growth.  Below are profiles on five of the most influential designer founders and their incredibly hot startups.

4.3 Joe Gebbia, Airbnb

Joe defines the Airbnb experience. He is dedicated to creating an inspiring and effortless user experience through sharp, intuitive design, and crafts the product roadmap to make it so. Joe values products that simplify life and have a positive impact on the environment, and ensures that the company adheres to these tenets.

Prior to Airbnb, Joe was employed by Chronicle Books, co-founded a green design website, and developed several consumer products. An alumni of the Rhode Island School of Design, Joe earned dual degrees in Graphic Design and Industrial Design.

It’s getting harder and harder to differentiate based on tech talent alone. Designers like Jonathan Ive at Apple, Joe Gebbia at Airbnb, and the rockstar design team at Dropbox (just to name a few) are changing the world today – not entirely because Apple, Airbnb, or Dropbox have better tech, but because they make their products more usable, aesthetic, and human.

Design is the link missing from your founding team. The perfect balance of business, tech, and design is an incredibly powerful tool… 

and an even more powerful business model.

Finding Great Talent

5.1 Okay, I need a designer. 
What do I look for?

Founders need to share passion, drive, and vision. Find someone who can solve problems and think critically about more than just designing a website. Someone who makes your founding team unstoppable.

5.2 Go where the designers are.
 
The design community is small and nuanced. Many designers aren’t aware of their increasing demand within startups, but that doesn't make them impossible to find.

Here are a few places where you can find excellent local designers right now.

Meetups and events are a great way to break into the design culture and mingle with prospective talent face-to-face. I strongly recommend you attend at least one design meetup – it’s really important to have that perspective going into your designer search.

Creative Mornings
Warm Gun
Meetup.com – Search for “Design”
Plancast.com – Search for “Design” Eventbrite.com – Search for “Design”

There’s always something going on.

Think of Zerply as LinkedIn for designers, developers, and entrepreneurs. It’s an exquisitely designed platform that operates on a network connections and recommendations. Members can be “recommended” for excellence in a variety of disciplines and skills.

Zerply allows you to search for designers by location, skills, and talents. The system is free to use.

Dribbble is an exclusive online community of designers from around the world. Signup is by (rare) invite only, which helps cultivate some of the best design talent in the world.

Designers post works-in-progress (wip), completed projects, teasers, and fun work so designers and 'spectators' from anywhere can catch a glimpse of what they're working on.

The site allows you to search for designers by skill, availability, and location. You can also advertise on the dribbble job board to allow some of the world’s best designers to come to you.

Behance: The Platform to Showcase & Discover Creative Work

Behance is a great place for anyone to browse top creative works attributed to the actual designers who created them, not agencies. It lets designers showcase work as their own and on sites like LinkedIn, RISD, Zerply, and AIGA, and their own personal websites – enticing some of the world's best talent to join the network.

The JobList makes it easy to reach over 1,000,000 skilled designers, sorted by field, location, or even specific tools and skills. Tons of startups and big companies (like Apple!) are already using Behance to recruit top designers around the world.

5.3 A note about Unicorns by Sacha Greif Understand your expectations.

In a smart article about finding designers on TNW, Sacha Greif tells a cautionary tale. "Instead of looking for a unicorn ["a magical designer that can solve all [of a company’s] problems," according to Braden Kowitz], think about hiring a web designer who will focus on design, and a front-end engineer who will focus on code. Like WePay’s Aberman states, “When looking for a designer, you can’t have it all. You need to prioritize visual design, product design, front-end development, etc.”

If your budget doesn’t let you hire both, another option is to hire a horse and let them grow a horn on the job: find a good visual designer who’s also willing to learn front-end coding, or a great front-end engineer who wants to get better at design."
